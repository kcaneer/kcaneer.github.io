            <p>Right now my blog incorporates a beginner's level of HTML, CSS,
                and Javascript interaction. My only blocker this week was incorrect
                punctuation in my code which caused the entire project to fail. I've
                learned from this that I need to work a little bit slower because it
                look me longer to debug the issue than it would have to do it right
                the first time around. Overall, I am feeling much more competent
                (for now!) and really enjoying each new concept. So far the most
                helpful thing to me has been reading Eloquent Javascript. The author
                explains things in a way that makes it much easier to grasp than
                just staring at code.

    <p>This week we dove head first into Javascript...and I'm back to feeling incompetent. I built a clock and a countdown
    timer. The functionality took so long that the styling is very basic. I am really enjoying having a better understanding
    of HTML and really understanding the basic structure of a webpage with links that take you somewhere. Creating this blog has 
    been a great learning experience to understand how the pieces fit together.

            <p>This week my brain has been stretched further than I knew it
            could go. We learned a lot of Javascript, how to get it to play nice
            with the HTML, we fell in love with Bootstrap (goodbye, CSS - as
            much as possible!), and we completed two projects (<a
            href="https://kcaneer.github.io/campaign/">campaign page</a> and <a
            href="https://kcaneer.github.io/read-your-mind/">mindreader</a>).
            The number one thing that held me back was comparing my progress to
            others who had previous experience coding. However, I found that
            once I jumped in and took the first step I was learning at an
            incredible speed. If I continue to learn this much every week of the
            bootcamp I can't even imagine where I'll end up. I would like to
            feel much more comfortable specifically with JSON but also generally
            with Javascript in the coming weeks. I am really enjoying learning
            Bootstrap and would like to continue learning how containers, rows,
            and columns interact. I have a good general understanding but
            frequently find myself frustrated at spacing and not sure where to
            look.</p>

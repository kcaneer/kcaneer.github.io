                <h2>Week 1:</h2>
                <p>Wow! A lot of change. A lot of downloading. Not much coding...yet.
                    Should be an exciting next few weeks but for now I am trying to just get my bearings
                    understanding how all of the pieces fit together. I am spending most of my time
                    trying to understand git and VS code as well as learning how to interact with my
                    terminal. I am most excited to start learning more of the basics like HTML and CSS
                    before moving on to Javascript.</p>
                <h2>Week 2:</h2>
                <p>This week we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and pseudocoding.
                    Overall, it was pretty simple and I really enjoyed the creativity
                    involved in the pseudocoding assignment. I chose to pseudocode a
                    robot that interacts with your Alexa to allow you to order
                    customized coffee right in your home without taking the time to hand
                    craft a beverage. Now I really want to make it a reality as
                    Starbucks has claimed too much of my discretionary income for the
                    last 5 years! </p>
                <h2>Week 3:</h2>
                <p>Right now my blog incorporates a beginner's level of HTML, CSS,
                    and Javascript interaction. My only blocker this week was incorrect
                    punctuation in my code which caused the entire project to fail. I've
                    learned from this that I need to work a little bit slower because it
                    look me longer to debug the issue than it would have to do it right
                    the first time around. Overall, I am feeling much more competent
                    (for now!) and really enjoying each new concept. So far the most
                    helpful thing to me has been reading Eloquent Javascript. The author
                    explains things in a way that makes it much easier to grasp than
                    just staring at code.</p>
                <h2>Week 4:</h2>
                <p>This week we dove head first into Javascript...and I'm back to feeling
                    incompetent. I built a clock and a countdown timer. The functionality took
                    so long that the styling is very basic. I am really enjoying having a better
                    understanding of HTML and really understanding the basic structure of a
                    webpage with links that take you somewhere. Creating this blog has been a
                    great learning experience to understand how the pieces fit together.</p>

                <h2>Week 5:</h2>
                <p>This week my brain has been stretched further than I knew it
                    could go. We learned a lot of Javascript, how to get it to play nice
                    with the HTML, we fell in love with Bootstrap (goodbye, CSS - as
                    much as possible!), and we completed two projects (<a
                        href="https://kcaneer.github.io/campaign/">campaign page</a> and <a
                        href="https://kcaneer.github.io/read-your-mind/">mindreader</a>).
                    The number one thing that held me back was comparing my progress to
                    others who had previous experience coding. However, I found that
                    once I jumped in and took the first step I was learning at an
                    incredible speed. If I continue to learn this much every week of the
                    bootcamp I can't even imagine where I'll end up. I would like to
                    feel much more comfortable specifically with JSON but also generally
                    with Javascript in the coming weeks. I am really enjoying learning
                    Bootstrap and would like to continue learning how containers, rows,
                    and columns interact. I have a good general understanding but
                    frequently find myself frustrated at spacing and not sure where to
                    look.</p>
